# Anther Project

## Project Overview

The Anther project aims to assist artists in evaluating the relationship between their songs and other content available on streaming platforms. The primary goal is to develop a service that enables artists to efficiently assess the compatibility of their songs with playlists.

## Key Features

- Search functionality to retrieve songs and playlists from the database
- Song processing to extract relevant data for analysis
- Comparison algorithm to cluster songs based on similarity
- Interactive D3 dashboard to visualize song clusters

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Frontend**: jQuery, HTML, CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Visualization**: D3.js

## Setup Local Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL
- Postico2
- Python (version X.X or higher)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anther-project.git
   cd anther-project
   ```

2. Set up the local settings:

   - Copy the content of `localsettingstemplate.py` into a new file called `localsettings.py`
   - Update `localsettings.py` with your local PostgreSQL environment details

3. Update the `launch.json` file with your local `manage.py` path

4. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

5. Install required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Set up the database:

   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Usage

The repo should run as is as a sandbox. To add new playlists for comparisons, navigate to the /search page in your browser and search new playlists. This should populate songs from the playlist and allow you to view them in the /playlists page.
